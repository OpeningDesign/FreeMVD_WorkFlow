### FreeMVD Workflow
---
This repo is a place to hash out simple IFC roundtripping between FreeCAD and Revit.

Hopefully, in the future, the FreeMVD will become more platform agnostic--applying to other BIM platforms as well.  

The evolving documentation lives [here](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/FreeMVD_WorkFlow/blob/master/BIM%20Specifications.md).
