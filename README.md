### FreeMVD Workflow

---

FreeMVD: Are experiments on how well certain objects roundtrip in/out of various BIM applications. We are always looking for volunteers, from other BIM applications, to add their results to these tests. If you can participate, ping [@yorik](https://github.com/yorikvanhavre) or [@theoryshaw](https://github.com/theoryshaw) and they can give you Github push privileges.

The evolving documentation lives in [here](./IFC_roundtrip_specifications.md).
